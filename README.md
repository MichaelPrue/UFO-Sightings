# UFO-Sightings
## Overview
In this webpage I have created dynamic tables for users to filter through different categories of UFO sighting. Users will be able to filter based on date, city, state, country and UFO shape. I did this by using Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

## Summary
### Drawbacks
-There is a limited amount of data especially when it comes to countries and the data could be a bit cleaner with captializations.

- Some of the categories could use drop down menus such as UFO shape and state so users know the options to chose from.
